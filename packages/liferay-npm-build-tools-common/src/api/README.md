# liferay-npm-build-tools-common/src/api

This folder contains the public API needed to:

-   Create bundler plugins and loaders
-   Manipulate `manifest.json` files

In general, this API must remain stable and be backward compatible.

Forward compatibility will also be maintained unless it is totally impossible
or very difficult to achieve.
